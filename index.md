## About Me

I'm a full-time PhD student at [HKUST Guangzhou](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), and I'm also an affiliate researcher at the [IDEA Research](https://www.idea.edu.cn/), working on Large Language Models.
<!-- I am engaged in pre-trained large language model work, including LLM, Multimodal LLM, and Diffusion-based AIGC model.  -->
I am one of the earliest developers in China to conduct research on [Pretrain Models](https://huggingface.co/IDEA-CCNL), [Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08166), and [Diffusion-based AIGC model](https://huggingface.co/IDEA-CCNL/Taiyi-Stable-Diffusion-1B-Chinese-v0.1).
Internship and work experience include internet companies, state-owned enterprises, and research institutes. 
Rich in technical passion and curiosity, enjoys sharing and exploring Data and Knowledge, Multimodal, Generative AI, and General Artificial Intelligence.
