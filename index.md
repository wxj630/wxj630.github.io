## About Me

I am a researcher in [FinAI Center](https://www.idea.edu.cn/research/research-finai.html) of IDEA, initial members [Fengshenbang Team](https://huggingface.co/IDEA-CCNL) previously. 
<!-- I am engaged in pre-trained large language model work, including LLM, Multimodal LLM, and Diffusion-based AIGC model.  -->
I am one of the earliest developers in China to conduct research on [Pretrain Models](https://huggingface.co/IDEA-CCNL), [Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08166), and [Diffusion-based AIGC model](https://huggingface.co/IDEA-CCNL/Taiyi-Stable-Diffusion-1B-Chinese-v0.1).
Internship and work experience include internet companies, state-owned enterprises, and research institutes. 
Rich in technical passion and curiosity, enjoys sharing and exploring Multimodal, Generative AI, and General Artificial Intelligence.
